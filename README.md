## HTML deliverable

For this deliverable I built out the structure of my application using HTML.

- [x] **HTML pages** - Four HTML pages that represent the ability to login, answer questions, view the progress, and chat.
- [x] **Links** - The login page links to the daily question page. A navigation bar on each page allows users to navigate between Home (login), Daily Question, Progress, and Chat.
- [x] **Text** - Each daily question, the progress, and the chat recordis is represented by a textual description.
- [x] **Images** - I added image on the login page(ü´∂üèª), browser tab, and the the background of the header.
- [x] **DB/Login** - Input box and submit button for login. The progress pages retrieve user-specific data from the database.
- [x] **Placeholder for 3rd party service calls** - Placeholder for future integration of an external API that could provide inspirational relationship question to enhance user engagement.
- [x] **WebSocket** - Real-time chat updates instantly show new messages in the chat page as they are sent.
